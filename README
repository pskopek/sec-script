This project creates script that can be used to secure (lock down) your JBoss AS installation.

Currently works for JBoss AS 6.1.0.Final.

TODO:
- JBoss AS 6.0.0.Final support
- JBoss AS 5.x support

How to use it
--------------
1. install JBoss AS
2. install Groovy
   -- use http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download
   -- use your OS favourite method: Fedora: yum install groovy
3. run groovy securejboss.groovy <JBOSS SERVER HOME>
   where <JBOSS SERVER HOME> is JBoss installation server home (aka profile directory)
4. check output for possible problems


Note: Always test your installation if it is secured properly.
